# Linux useradd command

There is a large number of commands. The commands, adduser and useradd are for the user management. The key difference between adduser and useradd is that adduser is used to add users with setting up account’s home folder and other settings while useradd is a low-level utility command to add users. This article discusses the difference between these two commands.

Every file in Linux or Unix has a user. There are three types of users in Linux. They are a user, group and other. ‘User’ is the owner of the file. By default, the user who creates the file becomes the user. ‘Group’ can contain multiple users. All users in the group have the same file permissions. It is possible to add many users to the group and assign group permissions. ‘Other’ doesn’t create the file, but they have access to the file.

In this way, the files are kept separately from each user. The users can read, write and execute. Read permission list the content. Write permission allows modifying the content. In Linux or Unix, it cannot run a program without the execute permission.
